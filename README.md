ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @reedetile . I am a PhD student at the university of vermont researching amphibian disease ecologist. I fill the niches of a community and disease ecologist,
as well as herpetologist. Being on github makes me feel like a frog out of water (doing okay, but not great). I code mostly in R though I have some experience in python. 
My intended use of github is as a repository and for a personal website. The purpose of my coding is mostly for statistical analysis, although I do some modelling and simulation
